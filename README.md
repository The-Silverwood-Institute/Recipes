# Recipes

**This repo is now redundant as recipes are written in Scala and stored in the parent repo [Recibase](https://github.com/The-Silverwood-Institute/Recibase)**

Our recipe collection, written in a format that [Recibase](https://github.com/The-Silverwood-Institute/Recibase) can ingest.

The schema is still undergoing rapid interation and most recipes [are still being added.](/../../issues/1). Once the schema stabalises it will be documented. For now check out how existing recipes are structured.
